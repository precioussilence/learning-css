### Practice: Evolving CSS Foundations

This directory reinterprets the core principles from Steps 1-5 through the lens of modern CSS—preserving their conceptual brilliance while embracing current best practices.

"Timeless design patterns deserve timeless implementations." Here, we honor the original solutions' intent while delivering:

- 3× reduction in layout code
- Native browser performance advantages
- Future-ready architecture

**Why This Matters**

The approaches in Steps 1-5 represent web development's foundational wisdom. This practice shows how to adapt that wisdom for:

- Today's browsers (Post-2020 CSS support)
- Modern tooling (CSS Modules, PostCSS)
- Emerging standards (Container Queries, Cascade Layers)
