### My Journey with CSS: Falling Down, Getting Up, and Finally Moving Forward

Long ago, I first attempted to learn front-end development, but time and again, my efforts were cut short by the frustrations of CSS. As the saying goes, "CSS has beaten me black and blue, yet I keep coming back like a lovesick fool." Over the years, I’ve stumbled, gotten back up, only to fall again—trapped in a cycle of frustration. Until I discovered Shay Howe’s incredible tutorial, [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/). Finally, something clicked. For the first time, I gained real traction and a sense of accomplishment.

But as time passed, I noticed my hard-won knowledge slipping away. Determined not to let it fade, I turned to the old adage: "The palest ink is better than the sharpest memory." This repository documents my step-by-step journey through Shay Howe’s tutorial—not just as a refresher for myself, but as a reference for anyone else struggling to make sense of CSS. 

If these notes help even one fellow learner find their "aha" moment, I’ll consider that a win.
