### Step 2: Structuring the Page Layout

When building a webpage, the first crucial step is planning its structural foundation. Here, we'll leverage HTML5 semantic elements—like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>` and `<article>`—instead of relying solely on generic `<div>` tags.

Why? Semantic markup does more than organize code:

- Maintainability: Clearly conveys intent to developers

- SEO: Helps search engines understand content hierarchy

- Accessibility: Improves experience for users with assistive technologies

By choosing meaning over markup, we create pages that work better for everyone—both machines and humans.
