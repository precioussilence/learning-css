### Step 3: Positioning Elements (Learning Legacy Approaches)

With our structural foundation in place, we now turn to element positioning—the art of placing components precisely where they belong to achieve the desired visual flow.

For this implementation, we'll follow Shay Howe's tutorial using the inline-block approach, one of CSS's fundamental positioning methods. While modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid offer more powerful alternatives (to be explored later), mastering these traditional methods builds crucial foundational skills.

Why start here when modern solutions exist?

- Understanding legacy techniques (like inline-block, float, and position) helps debug older codebases.

- Mastering constraints of older methods makes Flexbox/Grid's advantages more apparent.

- This step-by-step progression ensures we understand the evolution of CSS layout techniques before embracing newer solutions.

**Note**: For production projects today, modern layout systems like Flexbox or CSS Grid—or even component libraries—are more efficient and maintainable. We'll implement those in later sections.
