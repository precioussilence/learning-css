### Step 1: Adding CSS Resets for Consistent Cross-Browser Styling

Every browser and platform has its own default styles - each interpreting CSS rules slightly differently. This means identical code can render inconsistently across browsers, creating a fragmented user experience. Fortunately, the web development community has crafted an elegant solution: CSS Resets.

As browsers and standards evolved, various reset approaches emerged. Some gained popularity then faded, while others like Normalize.css evolved continuously. Here we're using Modern Normalize - a refined version that preserves useful defaults while eliminating inconsistencies, giving us a clean, predictable foundation across all browsers.
