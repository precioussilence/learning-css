              <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>
            </header>
            <div>
              <p>
                Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball
                tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217;t end with
                neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten
                rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good
                work to get done, or it&#8217;s what stifles a workforce. For
                design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we
                need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to
                succeed.
              </p>

              <p>
                In Aaron&#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the
                traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small.
                He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have
                that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to
                change your own workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve
                worked within a culture of design it&#8217;s almost impossible
                to imagine yourself anywhere else.

                Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only
                with a combination of well-written narrative and effective
                storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker&#8217;s job to
                put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes,
                tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention,
                emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements
                that together comprise a well-told story.
              </p>

              <p>
                With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using
                stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in
                film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in
                film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards.
                We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might
                look to them for inspiration.

                JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested
                libraries like jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone.js and more, but how
                can we be sure that our code is ready for production? This talk
                will share tips on how writing tests can be written easily and
                quickly and how to remove buggy code through testing.
